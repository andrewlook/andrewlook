### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andrew

I'm an ML Engineer and artist based in Brooklyn, currently working at Notion AI.

You can find me at [andrewlook.com](https://andrewlook.com/) or you can see my art at [@andrewlookart](https://instagram.com/andrewlookart).

Some fun projects I've worked on recently:
- [SLML - Single Line Machine Learning](https://andrewlook.com/projects/slml.html): I'm training SketchRNN on a dataset of thousands of drawings that I've made.
- [Titanic's End](https://github.com/titanicsend/LXStudio-TE) Mutant Vehicle: Making audio-reactive GLSL shader patterns to be displayed on > 100,000 LED's during concerts. Here's the latest shader I'm working on: [vortex.fs](https://github.com/titanicsend/LXStudio-TE/pull/448).

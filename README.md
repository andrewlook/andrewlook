### Hi 👋 I'm Andrew

I'm an ML Engineer, former startup founder and artist based in Brooklyn.

You can find me at [andrewlook.com](https://andrewlook.com/) or you can see my art at [@andrewlookart](https://instagram.com/andrewlookart).

Fun projects I've been working on lately:
- [SLML - Single Line Machine Learning](https://andrewlook.com/projects/slml.html), where I'm training SketchRNN on a dataset of thousands of drawings that I've made.
- Making audio-reactive GLSL shader patterns, for use during concerts, to drive the LED artwork on [Titanic's End](https://github.com/titanicsend/LXStudio-TE) Mutant Vehicle. Here's the latest shader I'm working on: [vortex.fs](https://github.com/titanicsend/LXStudio-TE/pull/448).
